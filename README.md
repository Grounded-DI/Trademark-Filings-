Deterministic AIâ„¢ and Deterministic Intelligenceâ„¢ are proprietary terms authored and defined by Grounded DI LLC. They refer to systems, architectures, and methods that operate under logic-locked, non-probabilistic reasoning â€” governed by scroll-sealed structure and entropy-based integrity constraints.

These terms are not generic descriptors. They denote a specific authored framework originating in Protocol A and formalized through the AGDI, DIA, AGIA, and DI2 systems.

Any use of Deterministic AIâ„¢ or Deterministic Intelligenceâ„¢ to describe systems that rely on stochastic inference, probabilistic modeling, or prompt-driven mimicry is inconsistent with their definition, authorship, and sealed operational form.
